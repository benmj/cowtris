# Cowtris 3

Cowtris is a falling block game with cows. Versions 1 and 2 of the game were written in Visual Basic. This project aims to port the game to HTML5.

See readme-2.1.md for the original description.

The original game was coded by David Glick (davisagli) and published by Nonsense Software. If you dig into the annals of history, you'll find that NS was four teenagers from Indiana who made computer games, biked, and built model recreations of medieval weaponry. In terms of games, Cowtris was their finest work and its legacy casts the longest shadow.

## Installation / Play

As of 2013-04-11 you can <a href="http://blog.benbybenjacobs.com/cowtris">play online</a>!

To play the game, you'll need to check out a copy of the repository (or download the ZIP file). You can then open the `index.html` file in your web browser. 

*NOTE:* Due to limitations in the browser's `localstorage`, high score functions will only work if you serve the files from a web server.

I'll put this online somewhere soon so you don't have to go through these steps. Promise.
